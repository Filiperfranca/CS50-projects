1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
The listener of this playlist could be characterized as an upbeat individual. The average energy level of the songs indicates a preference for more energetic rather than calm music, yet it is not chaotic. This is balanced by the inclusion of more emotive and melancholy tracks. However, none of these songs are from B-list or obscure artists, which highlights a taste for popular, mainstream music. In summary, their "audio aura" suggests a person who enjoys living life with intensity and deep emotion, seeking to feel experiences on both a cerebral and a physical level.

2. Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
The method used for the analysis was rigid and simplistic, based on an average energy calculation of all songs on the playlist with a subjective overlay from viewing the artists. However, this method is highly susceptible to error, indeed, it is more prone to failure than success. This is because listeners rarely engage with playlists in their entirety; instead, they seek specific songs, whether due to preference or a transient mood. A more robust analysis would involve a table of the listener's data indicating the most-played tracks. By filtering these top tracks in descending order and calculating the average energy of a limited sample, such as the top 10, we could obtain a much more accurate approximation of the listener's "audio aura."
